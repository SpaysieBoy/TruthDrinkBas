If they choose to drink, then they cannot win the round. The next player will then ask the remaining question found on the card. If both players are willing to answer the question, then the dealer will choose which answer they liked best. The player who gives the best, or only, answer will win a Question Card.
Gameplay will continue clockwise around the group. Players may use their Strategy cards to redirect questions that they do not want to answer without forfeiting the round. These may be played during any turn, even if it is not your own. Each player should make sure they have three Strategy Cards at the start of every round"
